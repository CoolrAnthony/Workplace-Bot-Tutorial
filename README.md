# Workplace-Bot-Tutorial Readme

This tutorial was created by Coolr's CTO, [Anthony Sheldrake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonysheldrake/). Coolr are facebook's first ever partner in EMEA, the PRCA Digital Agency of the year 2019 and the owners of the world record for the most retweeted commercial tweet. We're pretty awesome.

There's lots of bot tutorials out there but we wanted to make one specifically for Workplace by Facebook. You can read the [full tutorial here](https://www.wearecoolr.com/tutorial-how-to-build-a-bot-in-workplace-part-1/) . If you get stuck at any time, come and chat with us in our [Workplace Multi Company Group](https://fb.me/g/1nHsWUVCQ/ULkCqoDp).

This repository shows the bot exactly as it should look if you've followed the tutorial to the end (we've added a few comments to help you work out what does what but the code is identical). If you just want to deploy it straight away, we have also created an Heroku-ready version, which you can view here.

If you're interested in learning more about Workplace, talk to us. We'll hook you up with a no-commitment 90 day free trial. And if you do decide that Workplace is for you, we can give you **free support, flexible billing and your first bot is free!**
